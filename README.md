## 🚗 Vehicle Count Prediction from Sensor Data

This project focuses on predicting the number of vehicles passing through a particular road segment using sensor data. With the increasing importance of intelligent transportation systems and smart city infrastructure, accurate vehicle count prediction plays a crucial role in traffic management, congestion control, and urban planning.

### 📊 Overview

The dataset used in this project contains real-time data collected from road-embedded sensors, including time-based features (like hour, day, and date), environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, rain), and traffic signal information. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can learn patterns from historical sensor data and predict the vehicle count accurately for future timestamps.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a set of time-series sensor inputs, predict the number of vehicles passing through a specific road point. This is treated as a regression problem where the target variable is the vehicle count.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and other ML algorithms
* **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation
* **TensorFlow/Keras (optional)** for deep learning approaches

### 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   Handling missing values, formatting timestamps, and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Understanding trends, seasonal patterns, and correlation between features.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   Creating new time-based and aggregate features to enhance model performance.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   Training multiple regression models and comparing metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R².

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   Using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for model optimization.

6. **Prediction & Deployment (Optional)**
   Generating predictions and exporting the model for real-time deployment.

### 🚀 Outcomes

* Accurate vehicle count prediction models
* Insightful visualizations and analysis
* A scalable framework that can be adapted for real-world traffic systems
